My name is Kaden Patton, and I'm a student of Computer Science currently studying at Colorado State University. 

I'm proficient in many technologies, and am always learning more! 

In my free time, I tend to work on random projects -- some of which end up here! I love C++ and have special interest in computer security and all facets of software development.
